It can manage, process, and manipulate **Simple Features**, a formal geospatial data standard that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\n-   [**spNetwork**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/index.html), can perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It also can be used to build spatial matrices (‘listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\n-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) to plot cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spNetwork, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **2.2 Data Acquisition**\n\n2 datasets will be used to analyse the spatial distribution of childcare centre in Punggol planning area **(Both data sets are in ESRI shapefile format)**:\n\n-   `Punggol_St`, a line features geospatial data which store the road network within Punggol Planning Area.\n\n-   `Punggol_CC`, a point feature geospatial data which store the location of childcare centres within Punggol Planning Area.\n\n### **2.3 Importing Geospatial Data into R**\n",
