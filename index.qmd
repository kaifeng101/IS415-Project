Welcome to the Vietnam PCI Influence Analysis on FDI project!

In this project, we explore how various Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) factors influence Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) across Vietnam.

Through interactive visualizations and data models, we analyze the relationship between key PCI dimensions and FDI outcomes, providing valuable insights for understanding regional competitiveness and investment patterns.

Explore our findings and see how different factors contribute to shaping FDI across the country.
