    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nOur project explores how Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) factors impact Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) across Vietnam’s provinces. FDI is crucial for economic development, yet factors influencing its distribution at the provincial level are complex and multifaceted. Our study aims to identify the local and regional dynamics driving investment attraction, enabling policymakers to address economic disparities and promote balanced development.\nTo achieve this, we apply spatial analytics methods, including spatial pattern analysis and hotspot analysis, to examine how neighboring regions’ competitiveness correlates with local FDI levels. By identifying clusters of high and low competitiveness and regions with extreme FDI values, we uncover key influencing factors that help explain regional investment patterns.\nOur approach includes building both global and local models using multiple linear regression and stepwise model selection. These models highlight how PCI dimensions like entry costs and transparency influence FDI, with visualizations that display the strength of relationships and model fit across provinces. Local models provide province-specific insights, offering a tailored understanding of where policies may need improvement."

Compare across approaches to see which selection method aligns best with your confidence level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nSelect an FDI Measure:\n\nBegin by selecting either Total Number of Projects or Total Registered Capital from the tabs at the top to choose the FDI metric you want to examine.\n\nChoose a Stepwise Approach and Confidence Level:\n\nIn the left panel, select one of the following stepwise approaches to refine the model:\n\nForward: Adds factors based on significance.\nBackward: Removes less significant factors step-by-step.\nBoth: Balances forward and backward selection.\n\nSet a Confidence Level to control the threshold for including or excluding PCI factors in the model.\n\nGenerate the Plot:\n\nOnce you’ve selected your approach and confidence level, click Update Plot to view the results.\nThe results will display on the right panel, where each PCI factor’s influence is shown:\n\nLonger Lines indicate greater variation for that factor.\nRightward Positions represent positive autocorrelation, suggesting that increases in this factor are positively correlated with the FDI metric.\nLeftward Positions represent negative autocorrelation, showing a negative relationship with FDI.\n\n\nSort Results:\n\nTo view factors in Ascending or Descending order by impact, use the sort feature in the left panel. This can help you prioritize which PCI factors have the most or least influence on FDI based on your analysis."

Each approach evaluates bandwidth differently, so trying both can help identify which fits best with your data.\nKernel Type: For each bandwidth type, select a kernel function from the options:\n\nGaussian: Applies a normal distribution weight.\nExponential: Prioritizes nearby values, tapering with distance.\nBisquare: Gives weight within a defined radius, tapering sharply beyond it.\nTricube: Similar to Bisquare but with a smoother taper.\nBoxcar: Applies equal weight within a set distance.\n\n\n\nGenerate the Comparison Plot:\n\nOnce you’ve selected your bandwidth approach and kernel for both Fixed and Adaptive bandwidth types, click Update Plot to generate the visualization.\nThe resulting comparison plot will display on the right panel, with each bandwidth type side by side, letting you easily compare their effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nSelect an FDI Measure:\n\nBegin by navigating to either Total Number of Projects or Total Registered Capital at the top to specify the FDI measure for analysis.\n\nCustomize Bandwidth, Approach, and Kernel Settings:\n\nIn the left panel, configure the Local R² model settings:\n\nBandwidth Type: Choose between Fixed and Adaptive to determine how bandwidth adjusts across the model:\n\nFixed applies the same bandwidth across all regions.\nAdaptive adjusts bandwidth based on regional density.\n\nApproach: Select from Cross Validation or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to optimize the model fit.\nKernel: Choose a kernel function to define how distances are weighted within the model:\n\nGaussian: Applies a normal distribution weight.\nExponential: Gives more weight to closer points, tapering with distance.\nBisquare: Applies weight within a set radius, dropping sharply beyond it.\nTricube: Similar to Bisquare but tapers more smoothly.\nBoxcar: Assigns equal weight within a fixed distance.\n\n\n\nGenerate the Local R² Map:\n\nOnce you’ve selected the bandwidth, approach, and kernel, click Update Plot to generate the visualization.\nThe resulting map, displayed on the right, will show the Local R² values by province, allowing you to visually interpret where the model is performing well and where adjustments might be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nSelect an FDI Measure:\n\nBegin by choosing Total Number of Projects or Total Registered Capital at the top to set the focus of the FDI analysis.\n\nConfigure Bandwidth, Approach, and Kernel Settings:\n\nIn the left panel, set up the model specifications:\n\nBandwidth Type: Choose between Fixed and Adaptive for the bandwidth:\n\nFixed maintains the same bandwidth across all regions.\nAdaptive adjusts bandwidth according to regional density.\n\nApproach: Pick either Cross Validation or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model optimization.\nKernel: Select a kernel function to define distance weighting:\n\nGaussian: Applies weights using a normal distribution.\nExponential: Heavily weights closer points with a gradual tapering.\nBisquare: Weights points within a fixed radius, tapering sharply outside.\nTricube: Similar to Bisquare but with smoother tapering.\nBoxcar: Assigns equal weight within a fixed distance.\n\n\n\nSelect Independent PCI Variables:\n\nBelow the kernel setting, select the PCI factor (e.g., Entry Costs, Transparency) you wish to visualize.
