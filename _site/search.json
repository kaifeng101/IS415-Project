    "title": "Impact of PCI Dimensions on FDI in Vietnam’s Provinces",
    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nOur project explores how Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) factors impact Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) across Vietnam’s provinces. FDI is crucial for economic development, yet factors influencing its distribution at the provincial level are complex and multifaceted. Our study aims to identify the local and regional dynamics driving investment attraction, enabling policymakers to address economic disparities and promote balanced development.\nTo achieve this, we apply spatial analytics methods, including spatial pattern analysis and hotspot analysis, to examine how neighboring regions’ competitiveness correlates with local FDI levels. By identifying clusters of high and low competitiveness and regions with extreme FDI values, we uncover key influencing factors that help explain regional investment patterns.\nOur approach includes building both global and local models using multiple linear regression and stepwise model selection. These models highlight how PCI dimensions like entry costs and transparency influence FDI, with visualizations that display the strength of relationships and model fit across provinces. Local models provide province-specific insights, offering a tailored understanding of where policies may need improvement."
